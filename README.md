This website is a template for producing a marketing site for Danish Psychotherapist Stine Poulsen. It provides a clear overview of her main services, explains her therapeutic methods and contact options for scheduling appointments.

The site was build as part of a Diploma in Software Development course at Code Institute and is in english for assessment purposes. As the Psychotherapist predominantly has Danish clients, the website will be translated and adapted into danish in the near future.

## 1. User Experience (UX)

### 1.1 Project introduction
A website for a client with a secondary job/business as a Psychotherapist. The purpose of the website is to provide potential customers with information about the therapy sessions on offer, and to incorporate call-to-actions to ensure bookings of sessions.
The Psychotherapist is experiencing an increased demand from her customers to have a place with easily accessible information about both her and of her services. The aim of the website is to fullfill this demand.

### 1.2 Design guidelines
The Psychotherapist deals a lot with clients who approach her with highly sensitive and deep issues, for example incest, addictions and victims of rape. To accommodate this, the website design needs to be calm, soothing and confidence building.
In our meeting regarding design ideas, the psychotherapist expressed a desire to draw upon the calmness of a forest.

### 1.3 Project goals
- Provide well structured information about the Psychotherapist and her services.
- Structure the information in a manner that takes 3 distinct user types into account.
- Make contact information readily available throughout the site.

### 1.4 Target audience
The website is aimed at people searching for a Psychotherapist or a Gestalttherapist who offers services in Copenhagen or Jægerspris. The current clients of the business are a fairly even mix of both sexes, and spans ages from late teenagers till pensioners.
 
My client has identified 3 different user types, whom she needs the website design to accommodate for.

- **Returning clients**<br> 
    Someone who has used her services before. They would primarily be visiting the website to find contact information.<br>
    **Needs**: A quick path to contact information.<br>
    **Goal**: Provide easy access to methods of contacting the Psychotherapist.<br>
    **How**: Clearly distinguish the Contact section in the header navigation bar, and have the primary form of contact (a telephone number) present throughout the website.

- **Referred clients**<br> 
The Psychotherapist has colleagues with an overflow of clients, whom they refer to her services when relevant. Being referred from someone they already have a trusted relationship with provides the Psychotherapist with some inherited trust and confidence. They need specific information, but perhaps not a ton of background information.<br>
**Needs**: A solid overview of information specific to the type of therapy they are seeking, to confirm that the Psychotherapist is a good alternative.<br>
**Goal**: Provide a clear path from the index page to the section relevant for the referred client. Once there, provide a well structured overview that converts the referral into a booked session.<br>
**How**: Provide boxes with overview information about the primary therapy types on offer. Add a link to Read More about the specific type of therapy the client is seeking. Make seperate pages for the two primary therapy types on offer, and provide all relevant information there, including pricing and how to contact and book a session.

- **New Customer looking for a Psychotherapist** <br> 
    A potential client with no previous knowledge of the Psychotherapist. Most likely brougth to the site from a search engine whilst looking for a therapist. Might need more convincing (information) than the 2 previously described users.<br>
    **Needs**: An overview of what the Psychotherapist has to offer, and access to a deeper level of background information about the Psychotherapist and the form of therapy she has to offer.<br>
    **Goal**: Provide clear overview of products offered, and easy navigation paths to further information, whether that be the Psychotherapists Resumé, pricing or contact information.<br>
    **How**: Provide a Welcome Page with a clean overview of services offered and easy navigation to further information about the Psychotherapist. 

### 1.5 User stories



### 1.6 Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The main colours used are green(#0f352d), white (#ffffff) and a dash of brown (#35251a). These colours are chosen to accomodate for my clients wishes of a calm foresty inspired theme.

-   #### Typography
    -   The Roboto font is the main font used with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Roboto isn't being imported into the site correctly. Oswald is used for headings, also with Sand Serif as fallback.

-   #### Images
    -   On larger devices a background image of a forest is used to enhance the calm forest theme. 
    -   For the rest of the website design imagery is kept at a minumum and limited to displaying a profile photo of the psychotherapist. This is done with the intend to produce a calm site appereance that respects the serious subject matter.
